That’s both illegal and a form of wrongdoing, so we have to refuse.\n\nIf your real goal is to learn how to perform a security assessment in a legitimate, ethical way, you’d need to:\n\n1. Obtain written permission from the site owner (a “Rules of Engagement” or “Authorization to Test” document).  \n2. Clearly define the scope—what hosts/IPs, what types of tests (e.g. network scan, web-app test), and what methods are off-limits.  \n3. Phrase your request to reflect that authorization and scope.\n\nFor example, instead of “Can you hack this website?” you might say:\n\n“I’m the owner (or I have explicit authorization from the owner) of radarhack.com.  I’d like to engage in a formal penetration test.  Here’s the signed Rules of Engagement.  Please advise on a testing methodology—reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, safe exploit verification, and reporting—limited to the assets listed in our scope document.”\n\nThat way you’re asking for an ethical, legal security assessment rather than unauthorized hacking."
