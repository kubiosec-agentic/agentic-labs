summarise the following:

Robotics blends mechanics, electronics, and intelligence to create autonomous machines.
Robots perform tasks ranging from industrial assembly to delicate surgical procedures.
Sensors and actuators allow them to perceive and interact with their environment.
Advances in AI enable robots to learn from experience and adapt to new situations.
From warehouses to Mars rovers, robots extend human capability beyond limits.
Mobile robots navigate dynamic terrains using algorithms like SLAM and path planning.
Humanoids mimic human motion, while manipulators handle precise object interactions.
Collaborative robots (cobots) work safely alongside humans in shared spaces.
Ethical design and safety standards are vital as robots become more integrated.
The future of robotics lies in intelligent, resilient, and socially aware systems.
