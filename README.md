# Welcome to Agentics-labs
## Introduction
Agentics-Labs is an advanced, hands-on training experience for those who want to go beyond the hype and dive deep into the foundations of agentic AI. Whether you're a DevOps engineer, ethical hacker, network specialist, pen-tester, or developer, this course is your gateway to mastering the low-level internals of the OpenAI ecosystem.

You'll learn how to:

    Work directly with the OpenAI API and the new Agents SDK

    Build and chain intelligent agents using LangChain and custom tools

    Understand how agentic systems plan, reason, and act in complex environments

    Integrate AI agents into real-world workflows for security, automation, and development

This is more than just a workshop—it's an exploration of how intelligent agents are transforming the way we build and secure systems.

By the end, you'll not only know how to use AI—you'll know how to engineer it.

Let’s plug in, patch deep, and push the boundaries of what's possible.
Welcome to the lab.
