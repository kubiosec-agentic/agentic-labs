# Security Analysis Summary

## Executive Summary
The process traced involves the execution of the `curl` command, targeting `http://www.radarhack.com`. The analysis covers the sequence of operations from initialization to termination, focusing on network activities, file operations, and system calls pertinent to security.

## Key Findings and Phases

### Phases
1. **Initialization**: Setup involving library loading and memory configuration.
2. **Network Preparation**: DNS resolution and socket setup.
3. **SSL/TLS Negotiation**: Secure communication preparations.
4. **HTTP Request/Response**: Sending and receiving HTTP data.
5. **Termination**: Cleaning up resources and process exit.

### Network Activity
- **DNS Query**: Successfully resolved `www.radarhack.com`.
- **Connections**:
  - HTTP to `172.66.0.96:80`
  - HTTPS to `162.159.140.98:443`
- **Data Transfer**: HTTP GET request sent; server response indicated redirection.

### File Operations
- **Library Access**: Loading of shared libraries, crucial for SSL and HTTP operations.
- **Configuration Access**: SSL/TLS configurations through `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`.

## Security Implications

- **SSL/TLS**: Secure communications established over HTTPS, highlighting SSL setup logs.
- **Resource Management**: Use of `futex` and signal handling demonstrates stable multi-threaded operations.
- **Unsuccessful Access**: Search for `/etc/ld.so.preload` indicates an attempt to load libraries, with fallback observed for DNS resolution.
