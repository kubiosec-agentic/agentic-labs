## Quick Scan Results (Top 1000 Ports)
**Scan Command:** `nmap -sS -sV -O --top-ports 1000 --version-intensity 5 192.168.0.16`
**Scan Duration:** 4.28 seconds
**Host Status:** UP (0.0022s latency)

### Port Status
- **All 1000 scanned ports:** CLOSED (TCP reset responses)
- **Open Ports:** None detected in top 1000 common ports
- **Filtered Ports:** None detected

### Operating System Detection
**OS Fingerprinting Results (Confidence Level):**
1. **D-Link DFL-700 firewall (95%)** ⭐ Most Likely
2. HP Officejet Pro 8500 printer (93%)
3. ReactOS 0.3.7 (93%)
4. Rigol DS1000Z-series oscilloscope (93%)
5. HP LaserJet 4200 printer (93%)
6. Intel Express 510T switch (93%)
7. Thomson TCW710 wireless cable modem (93%)
8. Sonus GSX9000 VoIP proxy (93%)
9. Tandberg Codian videoconferencing system (NetBSD) (93%)
10. Apple Mac OS X 10.7.4 (Lion) (91%)

### Analysis Summary
**Device Type Assessment:**
- **Most Probable:** Network Security Device (D-Link Firewall)
- **Alternative:** Network Infrastructure Device (Switch/Router)
- **Behavior:** All ports closed with TCP reset responses

**Security Profile:**
- ✅ **Hardened Configuration:** No open ports on common service ports
- ✅ **Firewall Behavior:** TCP resets suggest active filtering
- ✅ **Low Attack Surface:** Minimal exposed services
- ⚠️ **Stealth Operation:** Device designed to be non-intrusive

**Network Role:**
Based on the fingerprint and behavior, this device is likely:
1. **Security appliance** (firewall/IPS) protecting network segment
2. **Network infrastructure** device with management interface disabled
3. **Hardened server** with restrictive firewall rules

## Comprehensive Scan Status
**Background Scan:** IN PROGRESS
- Full port range scan (1-65535) with vulnerability detection
- Service enumeration and aggressive OS detection
- NSE script execution for detailed analysis
- Expected completion: Additional 10-15 minutes

**Scan Command:** 
```bash
nmap -sS -sV -O -A --script=default,vuln,safe -p- --max-retries 2 \
     --max-rtt-timeout 5s --min-rate 300 192.168.0.16
```

## Recommendations
1. **Monitor** comprehensive scan results for any high-numbered ports
2. **Verify** device purpose if it's supposed to be a server/workstation
3. **Check** if this is an authorized security device in your network
4. **Review** network documentation for device identification
