# Nmap done at Sun Sep 14 19:08:22 2025 -- 256 IP addresses (39 hosts up) scanned in 6.87 seconds

=== NMAP SCAN ANALYSIS ===
Network: 192.168.0.0/24 (256 addresses)
Active hosts discovered: 39
Scan duration: 6.87 seconds
Scan type: Ping scan (-sn) with TCP SYN probes to ports 22,80,135,443,3389,5985

Key findings:
- 39 active hosts discovered (15.2% host density)
- Gateway likely at 192.168.0.1 (30ms latency)
- Network includes various device types (routers, workstations, servers)
- Some hosts show high latency (up to 4.4s) indicating potential network congestion or wireless devices
- Fast local responses (<5ms) suggest wired infrastructure devices
