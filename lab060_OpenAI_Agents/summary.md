# Security Analysis: `curl` Process Trace

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the execution of a `curl` command—run as root—to retrieve content from `http://www.radarhack.com`, following redirects. The process occurs within a Docker context, utilizes extensive shared libraries for HTTP and SSL, conducts DNS resolution through an internal server, and ultimately fetches HTML content via successful IPv4 HTTP/HTTPS connections. No local privilege escalation or clear indicators of compromise were observed at the syscall level, though certain domains and IPs warrant further verification.

---

## Key Findings & Phases

### 1. Process Initialization
- **Command**: `/usr/bin/curl -L http://www.radarhack.com`
- **Privileges**: Runs as root (UID 0)
- **Environment**: Standard PATH, inside cgroups/Docker

### 2. Library and Config Loading
- Loads numerous shared libraries (libcurl, libssl, libcrypto, etc.) for HTTP, TLS, compression, and crypto.
- Reads system configuration and certificate files (`/etc/ld.so.cache`, `/etc/nsswitch.conf`, `/usr/lib/ssl/openssl.cnf`, `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`).

### 3. Network Activity
- **DNS Resolution**: UDP queries sent to internal DNS (172.31.0.2); receives replies with target and redirected domains.
- **HTTP/HTTPS Connections**:
  - IPv6 connection attempts fail (ENETUNREACH), falling back to IPv4.
  - Successful TCP connections to 172.66.0.96 (HTTP) and 162.159.140.98 (HTTP/HTTPS).
  - HTTP 301 redirect received; subsequent HTTPS/TLS handshake follows.
- **Data Transfer**: HTML content received and written to stdout.

### 4. File Operations
- Accesses and reads several libraries, config, and certificate files.
- Attempts and fails to connect to the Name Service Cache Daemon socket (`/var/run/nscd/socket`).

## Security Implications

- **Root Execution**: Running `curl` as root enlarges the potential attack surface.
- **DNS/Network Trust**: DNS replies reference potentially suspicious domains (e.g., `sea-turtle-app-l44j9.ondigita`), suggesting need for domain reputation checks.
- **SSL Security**: Process properly loads CA certificates to verify HTTPS connections, indicating standard security hygiene.
- **No Malicious Syscall Activity**: No sign of privilege escalation, suspicious local file writes, or shell executions beyond process and network management.

## Recommendations

- **Domain and IP Review**: Investigate the legitimacy of `www.radarhack.com`, `sea-turtle-app-l44j9.ondigita`, and connected IPs.
- **Run as Non-Root**: Avoid running network tools with root privileges.
- **Monitor DNS Behavior**: Lack of NSCD caching and fallback mechanisms should be reviewed in the context of your DNS hygiene.
- **Inspect Content**: Consider deeper content analysis to check for signs of compromise outside syscall activity.
