# Welcome to Agentic-Labs Training

**Agentic-Labs** is an advanced, hands-on training experience for those who want to go beyond the hype and dive deep into the **foundations of agentic AI**. Whether you're a **DevOps engineer**, **ethical hacker**, **network specialist**, **pen-tester**, or **developer**, this course is your gateway to mastering the **low-level internals** of the OpenAI ecosystem.

## üîç What You'll Learn

- How to work directly with the **OpenAI API Chat completion**, the brand new **OpenAI responses API** and the new **OpenAI Agents SDK**
- How to build and chain intelligent agents using **LangChain** and custom tools
- The core principles behind **agentic systems** that plan, reason, and act
- How to integrate AI agents into real-world workflows for **security**, **automation**, and **development**
- How to debug AI agents using **MITM proxy** and **tracing**
- Security pitfalls and hacking challenges
  
This is more than just a workshop, it's an exploration of how intelligent agents are transforming the way we build and secure systems.
By the end, you'll not only know how to use AI, you'll know how to *engineer* it.
Let‚Äôs plug in, patch deep, and push the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible.

Welcome to the lab and let's **#HACKTOLEARN** üöÄ

## üîê Getting Access to the Lab via SSH

Each lab student has access to a virtual machine, accessible over SSH. Use the credentials provided to you and use the following pattern to connect:
### Terminal_1
```bash
ssh -i agentics-key.pem -L 8080:localhost:8080 \
               -L 8081:localhost:8081 \
               -L 8000:localhost:8000 \
               -L 5000:localhost:5000 \
               -L 8501:localhost:8501 \
                ubuntu@x.x.x.x.x
```
```
git clone https://github.com/kubiosec-agentic/agentic-labs.git
```
```
cd agentic-labs/lab000_setup/
```
```
./setup.sh
```
```
./prepare_labs.sh
```
```
cd ..
```
### To open Terminal_2 and Terminal_3 during labs use:
```bash
ssh -i agentics-key.pem  ubuntu@x.x.x.x.x
```
**Note**: 
- Provided lab environment is based on Ubuntu, T2.medium and 50G root volume. 
- Labs are tested and should also run on Mac.
