# Welcome to Agentics-Labs Training

**Agentics-Labs** is an advanced, hands-on training experience for those who want to go beyond the hype and dive deep into the **foundations of agentic AI**. Whether you're a **DevOps engineer**, **ethical hacker**, **network specialist**, **pen-tester**, or **developer**, this course is your gateway to mastering the **low-level internals** of the OpenAI ecosystem.

## üîç What You'll Learn

- How to work directly with the **OpenAI API Chat completion**, the brand new **OpenAI responses API** and the new **OpenAI Agents SDK**
- How to build and chain intelligent agents using **LangChain** and custom tools
- The core principles behind **agentic systems** that plan, reason, and act
- How to integrate AI agents into real-world workflows for **security**, **automation**, and **development**
- How to debug AI agents using **MITM proxy** and **tracing**
- Security pitfalls and hacking challenges
  
This is more than just a workshop, it's an exploration of how intelligent agents are transforming the way we build and secure systems.
By the end, you'll not only know how to use AI‚Äîyou'll know how to *engineer* it.
Let‚Äôs plug in, patch deep, and push the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible.

Welcome to the lab and let's **#HACKTOLEARN** üöÄ

## üîê Getting Access to the Lab via SSH

Each lab environment runs in its own isolated container or virtual machine, accessible over SSH. Use the credentials provided to you and the following pattern to connect:

```bash
ssh your-username@labXX.agentics.labs
# Replace XX with the lab number, e.g., 01, 02, ..., 11
```

## üß™ Lab Overview
Each lab is structured to gradually build your understanding and capabilities‚Äîfrom basic API calls to full agent orchestration and security integration.
