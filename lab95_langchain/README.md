# LangChain and LangGraph Quickstart
This lab demonstrates how to build powerful language model workflows using LangChain and LangGraph.
**LangChain** is a flexible framework for composing prompts, models, tools, and logic into modular pipelines called chains.
**LangGraph** builds on top of LangChain by allowing you to define stateful, multi-step graphs with branching logic, ideal for building agents and complex decision-making systems.

With just a few lines of code, you can:
- Create structured chains: connect prompts, language models, and output parsers
- Build intelligent agents: LLM-powered systems that can make decisions and call tools
- Use LangGraph to model flows as stateful graphs with memory and control

This lab includes minimal examples to help you get started with each concept.
