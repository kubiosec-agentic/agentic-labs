# LAB09: Enterprise ready Agents
## Introduction
This lab explores key concepts in Authentication, Authorization, and Observability for AI-integrated systems:
- OAuth flows for machine-to-machine (M2M) and web app auth using real code examples.
- Logging and tracing (coming soon) for monitoring agent behavior and API interactions
- RAG with metadata (coming soon) to enhance retrieval and reasoning with structured context

Ideal for securing and debugging AI-powered applications in production environments.
## Set up your environment
```
export OPENAPI_API_KEY="xxxxxxxxx"
```
```
./lab_setup.sh
```

## Lab instructions
### OAuth 2.0 M2M API Server with OpenAI Integration
[OAuth 2.0 M2M API Server with OpenAI Integration](https://github.com/kubiosec-ai/openai-oauth-demo/blob/main/client.py)<br>
This FastAPI application demonstrates how to build a secure Machine-to-Machine (M2M) service, implementing both authentication and authorization using OAuth 2.0 with Amazon Cognito. It protects endpoints by verifying incoming JWT access tokens against Cognito’s public keys (JWKS), ensuring that only authorized services can access the API. The app also integrates OpenAI’s API to generate AI-powered responses for authenticated requests. It includes:
- Token validation using JWKS with caching
- Scope checking to authorize access to specific endpoints
- Two protected endpoints:
  - /receive-story: receives story data
  - /ask: accepts a question and returns a response generated by OpenAI
