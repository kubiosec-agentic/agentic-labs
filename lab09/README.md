# LAB09: Enterprise ready Agents
## Introduction
This lab explores key concepts in Authentication, Authorization, and Observability for AI-integrated systems:
- OAuth flows for machine-to-machine (M2M) and web app auth using real code examples.
- Logging and tracing (coming soon) for monitoring agent behavior and API interactions
- RAG with metadata (coming soon) to enhance retrieval and reasoning with structured context

Ideal for securing and debugging AI-powered applications in production environments.
